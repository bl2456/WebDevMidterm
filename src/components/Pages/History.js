                        In late 1886, a gaggle of workers from the Woolwich Arsenal Armament Factory 
                        decided to form a football team. They called themselves Dial Square as a reference 
                        to the sundial atop the entrance to the factory.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        On December 11, 1886, Dial Square romped to a 6-0 victory over Eastern Wanderers; 
                        the first game in their initial guise. Shortly afterwards the name ‘Royal Arsenal’ was adopted.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In 1891, ‘Royal Arsenal’ became the first London club to turn professional and two years later 
                        renamed themselves into ‘Woolwich Arsenal’ following their ascend to the Second Division of The 
                        Football League.

                        By 1904, the club wins promotion to the First Division but is met with financial difficulties. As 
                        more accessible football clubs appear in the city, attendence records were at an all-time low, driving 
                        the club close to bankruptcy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By 1913, majority shareholder Sir Henry Norris made the decision to move the club north into Highbury, North London 
                        following the club's relegation to the Second Division. The move effectively sparked the century long rivalry between 
                        Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspurs. The following year the club changed it's name again, this time into ‘The Arsenal’. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Due to Sir Henry Norris's influence, the club was voted back to the First Division post World War I despite 
                        finishing 5th in the Second Division at the expense of rivals Tottenham Hotspurs.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By the end of 1919, the club gradually dropped the "The" from their name and would be referred to as ‘Arsenal’ henceforward.

                    <p>
                        With a new home and First Division football, attendances were more than double those at the Manor Ground, and Arsenal's 
                        budget grew rapidly. The club's new location and record-breaking salary brought star manager Herbert Chapman to the club. 
                        The club's financial power during this period would earn them the nickname of "Bank of England Club".
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Under Chapman, Arsenal won their first international trophy, the FA Cup, in 1930. Two League Championships followed in 1930-31 
                        and 1932-33. Suddenly, in the middle of the 1933-34 season, Chapman died of pneumonia and George Allison took over, bringing the 
                        club three more championships in 1934, 1935, and 1938. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The Football League would be suspended for seven years due to World War II. The club would win the league again in 1947-48 and 1952-53 
                        but the war had drained Arsenal of it's finances and players.

                        From this point onwards Arsenal would not win another title for 18 years. The squad was aging and the club failed to attract 
                        suitable replacements. Although the club made League Cup finals appearances in 1967-68 and 1968-69, it was until 1969-70 that 
                        the club were champions once again. This time winning their first competitive European Trophy: Inter-Cities Fairs Cup.

                        The season after saw a glimpse of hope for the club. Then manager Bertie Mee led the club to its first League and FA Cup double. 
                        However, that championship team was broken up and the club would not win anything until the 1979 FA Cup, seldomly finishing runner-up 
                        in the division and other domestic competitions.

                        Former Arsenal player George Graham, also part of the 1970-71 Double-winning squad, returned as manager in 1986. By 1987, he brought 
                        Arsenal its first League Cup and by 1988, brought the legendary defense consisting of Nigel Winterburn, Lee Dixon, Steve Bould, and 
                        Captain Tony Adams. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Under Graham, Arsenal snatched the 1988-89 League title, 1990-91 title (losing only one match), 1993 FA Cup and League Cup double, and 
                        the 1994 European Cup Winners' Cup. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In 1995, Graham was found to have taken an illegal £425,000 payment from Norwegian agent Rune Hauge for signing his clients for Arsenal 
                        and was dismissed by the club. He was subsequently banned by the Football Association for a year.

                        In 1996, Arsenal appointed their most well known manager: Arsene Wenger. The move was met with criticism as Wenger has had minimal experience 
                        in top-flight European football. However, Wenger's arrival brought a new style of attacking football along with dietary and fitness practices. 
                        Through these years, Wenger would establish himself as one of the top and most respected managers in the world through his style in developing 
                        young players and being efficient with spending.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Wenger looked to recruit talent from his homeland of France, bringing in prospects such as Patrick Viera and Thierry Henry, who would become the 
                        world's best players. Arsenal won a second League and Cup double in 1997-98 and a third double in 2001-02. Wenger also made Arsenal 2003 and 2005 
                        FA Cup champions. His most famous achievement would be the Invincible Season of 2003-04, where Arsenal would win the League title without losing a 
                        single game. The run of 49 games unbeaten is still a national record to this day. Arsenal were presented with an unique golden Premier League trophy 
                        that year.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During eight of Wenger's first nine seasons at the Arsenal, the club finished either first or second place. In 2005-06, the club reached the finals 
                        of the Champions League for the first time in club history, losing out 2-1 to Barcelona. Following that season the club moved to the Emirates Stadium, 
                        a move for the long-term that would see Arsenal financially handicapped for years to come. From 2005 to 2014, Arsene Wenger would develop a reputation 
                        to bring in unknown players, making them into stars, and ultimately reluctantly selling them to rival teams. The club would not see another trophy until 
                        winning the 2014 FA Cup.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Wenger would go onto win the 2015 and 2017 FA Cups before making the decision to depart on April 20th, 2018. His departure was met with thankful messages 
                        from those he had influenced in the Football world during his 22 years as a manager.
